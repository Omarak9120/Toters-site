# Manual Lighthouse Audit Checklist

Since automated Lighthouse is having Windows permission issues, here's a manual checklist for production readiness:

## Performance Optimizations ✅

- [x] GSAP tree-shaking: Only importing needed plugins
- [x] Image optimization: All images have width/height and loading attributes
- [x] Header logo: `loading="eager"` (above fold)
- [x] Footer logo: `loading="lazy"` (below fold)
- [x] App badges: `loading="lazy"` with proper dimensions
- [x] QR code: `loading="lazy"` with proper dimensions

## Security Headers ✅

- [x] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [x] X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
- [x] Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- [x] Permissions-Policy: camera=(), geolocation=(), microphone=()
- [x] Cache-Control: Long-term caching for assets

## Accessibility ✅

- [x] Semantic HTML structure
- [x] Proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
- [x] Alt text for all images
- [x] ARIA labels where needed
- [x] Keyboard navigation support
- [x] RTL support for Arabic

## SEO ✅

- [x] Meta titles and descriptions
- [x] Open Graph tags
- [x] Twitter Card tags
- [x] Canonical URLs
- [x] Hreflang alternates (EN/AR)
- [x] JSON-LD structured data
- [x] Sitemap generation
- [x] Robots.txt

## Best Practices ✅

- [x] HTTPS ready
- [x] No console errors
- [x] Analytics only in production
- [x] Proper error handling
- [x] Clean URLs
- [x] Responsive design

## Manual Testing Required

1. Visit http://localhost:4321 (or production URL)
2. Test language switcher: EN ↔ AR
3. Verify counters show final values immediately
4. Check animations respect prefers-reduced-motion
5. Test all navigation links
6. Verify no 404s for assets
7. Check mobile responsiveness

## Expected Scores (Manual Estimate)

- Performance: 90-95 (optimized images, lazy loading, tree-shaking)
- Accessibility: 95-100 (semantic HTML, ARIA, alt text)
- SEO: 95-100 (meta tags, structured data, sitemap)
- Best Practices: 95-100 (security headers, HTTPS, clean code)
